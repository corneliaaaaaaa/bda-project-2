# big-data-and-business-analytics-final-project
Students were assigned by the course to come up with and conduct projects which would help solve problems for [91App](https://www.91app.com/), a leading e-commerce and O2O (Online to Offline) platform based in Taiwan. The topic of our team's project is "Prediction Model of the Future NAPL Type of Clients" and needs to deal with data exceeding 1TB. The project members are Christine, Amber, jtc, Erica, yclai and Donkey.

#### Introduction of the topic
The NAPL model clustering allows us to understand the individual users' varying levels of value to the brand, enabling distinct advertising and marketing approaches for each group. Therefore, we are curious about:
* Which advertising and marketing strategies are effective?
* How should the brand retain high-value customers?

#### Goal
##### Original problems
* What did the high-value customers from the previous year do that would result in them becoming low-value customers a year later?
* What actions did the brand take with the high-value customers from the previous year that led to them becoming low-value customers a year later?
##### Expected outcome
* Provide recommendations for retaining high-value customers for the brand.
* Establish an NN classification model that allows the brand to predict the NAPL classification of a specific user one month ahead based on their given user data.
##### Future Application
* Once the brand has identified a list of high-value customers who are at risk of churning, they can take more proactive and effective actions to prevent a decrease in customer value.
* In the future, if other user classification models similar to NAPL emerge, they can directly emulate the implementation approach used in this project to understand the key reasons for different classification transitions and establish NN classification models for those classifications.

#### Solution
The solution can be separated into the following four steps.
1. Label users
2. Select features for the NN model
3. Preprocess data for the NN model
4. Build the NN model

#### What I have done
* Participated in brainstorming the project, problem statement, solution and future application.
* Wrote the code file for step 3, data preprocessing for the NN model.
